![Data Page](./PNGs/Screenshot%202025-03-10%20091844.png)

## Overview
This project aims to predict the number of medals (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) that each country will win in the 2024 Olympic Games. The predictions are based on historical Olympic data, demographic information, and economic indicators. The project leverages machine learning models to forecast medal counts, providing insights into the potential performance of countries in the upcoming Olympics.

The goal was to make the model as dependent on the year as possible, so that by simply tweaking the year column, the model would be able to make predictions for the 2024 Olympic medals.

**Note:** This is an early approach and can be improved upon. The current methodology provides a solid foundation, but there are opportunities for refinement, such as incorporating additional data sources,More Feature Engineering, experimenting with more advanced models, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Preparation**: The dataset includes historical Olympic data, demographic information, and economic indicators. The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and merged to create a comprehensive dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Various features are engineered, including athlete demographics, country-specific statistics, and historical medal counts.
- **Modeling**: Machine learning models (e.g., CatBoost, XGBoost) are trained to predict the number of medals each country will win in 2024.
- **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Prediction**: The final predictions are aggregated by country and medal type, providing a clear view of the expected medal distribution in the 2024 Olympics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following files:

- **dictionary.csv**: Contains demographic and economic information about various countries, including population and GDP per capita.
- **Olympic_Athlete_Bio.csv**: Provides detailed biographical information about Olympic athletes.
- **Olympic_Athlete_Event_Results.csv**: Contains data on athlete results for Olympic events, including rankings and medals.
- **Olympic_Games_Medal_Tally.csv**: Summarizes the total medal tally by country for each Olympic Games.
- **Olympic_Results.csv**: Provides detailed results for Olympic events.
- **Olympics_Country.csv**: Contains information about participating countries.
- **Olympics_Games.csv**: Provides information about the Olympic Games, including host cities and dates.
- **countries_olympics_medals.csv**: Contains records of Olympic medals won by countries, including participation counts and medal tallies for both summer and winter Olympics.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Missing values are handled by filling with mean or mode values.
   - Country names are standardized to ensure consistency across datasets.
   - Features such as athlete age, BMI, and historical medal counts are calculated.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Features like average height, weight, and age of athletes are calculated.
   - Historical medal counts and participation data are used to create features that capture a country's Olympic performance over time.

3. **Modeling**:
   - **CatBoostRegressor**: A gradient boosting algorithm optimized for categorical features.
   - **XGBoost**: A scalable and efficient implementation of gradient boosting.
   - Models are trained to predict the number of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals for each country.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Models are evaluated using RMSE to measure the accuracy of predictions.
   - Feature importance is analyzed to understand which factors contribute most to medal predictions.

5. **Prediction**:
   - The final predictions are aggregated by country and medal type.
   - The results are visualized to provide a clear view of the expected medal distribution in the 2024 Olympics.

## Results
The final predictions indicate the expected number of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals for each country in the 2024 Olympics. The top-performing countries are predicted to win the most medals, with the United States, China, and Germany leading the pack.

### Example Predictions:
| Country                     | Gold | Silver | Bronze |
|-----------------------------|------|--------|--------|
| United States of America    | 31   | 25     | 25     |
| People's Republic of China  | 22   | 15     | 16     |
| Germany                     | 13   | 14     | 13     |
| Great Britain               | 12   | 12     | 12     |
| Australia                   | 10   | 11     | 12     |
