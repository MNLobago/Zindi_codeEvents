# Overview

This Folder contains notebooks and resources related to the second-place solution for the challenge.

## Files Included

- **`2NDplace_Using_ACCmetric.ipynb`**  
  Notebook using **Accuracy** as the evaluation metric.

- **`AUC_2NDplace.html`**  
  HTML illustration of the second-place solution using the **AUC** metric.

## Metric Choice

For this challenge, I chose **Accuracy** as the primary metric to optimize. After careful consideration, I observed that Accuracy was the **tougher metric** compared to AUC. Targeting and outperforming on this more stringent metric resulted in **better performance on the leaderboard (LB)**.
